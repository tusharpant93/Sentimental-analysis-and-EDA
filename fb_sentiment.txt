  Heres a single, to add, to Kindle. Just read this 19th century story:
  "The Ghost of Round Island". Its about a man (French/American
  Indian) and his dog sled transporting a woman across the ice, from
 1Mackinac Island to Cheboygan - and the ghost that...                    O

  Why is Barnes and Nobles version of the Kindle so much more

  @Maria: Do you mean the Nook? Be careful, books you buy for the
  Kindle are for that piece of electronics, and vice versa. I love my
  Kindle, there are people that swear by the Nook. They like the color
  screen.Me? I want an ereader that is a reader-- so I dont need color.
  The kindle battery lasts longer, and the unit isnt as heavy, which can
 5make a difference after reading for a few hours. :)                     P

  Meh. I think Singles are a bad idea. Big name authors already
  dominate the market by a huge factor. Now you are letting them
  compete on price point with indie authors (albeit giving less content
 8for the money).                                                         N

  Got a Kindle for Xmas and I love it. Never was much of a book
11reader, but this has been fun. I am on my 5th book since Christmas! P
  I dont have the patience for kindle singles. If Im gonna read, I need
12at least 200 pages.                                                     P

  Not a fan of Kindle Singles. They clog up the Kindle Book page and
  its tough to sort through full-legnth new releases because there are
14so, so many Singles there.                                              N

  LOVE my Kindle..not sure if I got the update or not, though because
  I dont see any difference when I read. Color? I dont need color to
  read so Kindle is perfect. And Singles, Ive read a few, not really a
  fan or not oen way or another..I just like to read so I read whatever
22looks interesting at the time. Did I say....LOVE my Kindle? I sure do!! P
  Its just too bad you arent offering these for the Original Kindle.
  Seems like those of us who got on your bandwagon first are just left
23in the dust.                                                            N

26you arent missing a thing, I tried this game and it sucks!              O
  I have a couple games on my kindle...only problem is my family
27seems to think I put them on there for them...                          N

  So let me get this straight...Kindle is now a gaming device? Dont

  True Anders...although they are in it for the money:) Otherwise they
30wouldnt be in existence.                                                O
31Can we play these games on the kindle app on ipad?                      O
     Mr. Meisch, its ok; calm down :-P. Yes, they have games but the
     ones that I have tried (I have about 5 on my Kindle along with 30
     gazillion books) are either text based or just simple time killers. So
     far they are actually decent (well, what Ive tried is anyway. Ive heard
     of some awful ones).I have the one they are touting here and its...
     ok. Not my favorite (try Triple Town; its addictive) but this one is
     decent enough. The beginning is too easy by far, the middle is good
     and the end levels are killer.
32                                                                          P
  Is that right? Only the original Kindle? What about the 2nd
33generation?                                                               O
34They have free games also: blackjack, poker and word games.               P
35I love Every Word and Video Poker. For when your not reading.             P
  Are there any stand-alone interactive fiction (text adventure) games?
  I know there are some online ones but I dont have 3g and Id like to
36play away from wifi.                                                      O
  Kindle is a book... Stop making it into somthing its not...leave the
37games to other moble devices...                                           O
  Has anyone developed any games for the 1st generation Kindle? Im
  not going to get a new one just to play games...Even though I would
38like to have the option...                                                P
  I play Triple Town its fun...if you dont want the games, dont get
39them!                                                                     O
  I have a few games on my kindle and I enjoy them. I also enjoy the
  fact that while traveling I dont have to take multiple devices in order
40to stay busy while on an airplane or riding in a car.                     P
  If you dont like the games, dont buy them. I have a few games and
  its fun to be able to play a few games when I dont feel like reading.
41Not all of us have those fancy schmancy smart phones.                     P
  How does the kindle having an "OPTION" to download and play
  games on it ruin the experience of your Kindle? Complaining about it
42doesnt make any sense.                                                    N
43Yes De ra you can get it on the iPad. I just bought it.                   O
44love playing games on my kindle.                                          P
45Love triple town too                                                      P
  Some people just love to complain about everything. Like someone
46said if you dont want the games dont get them. Duh!!!!                    P
47um,how how do you play this on the kindle?                                O
48got it and it is so much fun and very addicting                           P
49You can play it on the original. I just downloaded it for 99 cents        O
50Its harder to play because you dont have color. Just pretend              N
  Some people may want games on their Kindle,thats fine, but i prefer
51to use my Kindle as a EReader. Love My Kindle !!!!                        P
  I dont have color on my kindle..maybe I will wait for others to say
52how they like it.                                                         P

   @Cara Bolton. Unfortunately, you have to re-purchase them, which I

   excited. Shortly afterwards a friend bought me a Kindle. I now know

116Best present i ever got was my kindle!! the battery lasts for months!! P
   I lovingly refer to my Kindle as my "Crackle" because its so
117addictive!                                                                O
   @Cara if you have the time and dont want to pay the extra you can
   scan your all books into caliber (an open format program) and
   convert them into mobi files. Is really better to just repurchase (since
   it is faster) but for short stuFf and college papers. I love scanning
   them and converting the file. You must scanned in as a PDF the use
118caliber for the conversion.                                              P

   I love my little Kindle,

130Best thing ever invented                                                 P
   Rose, I downloaded Every Word onto my Kindle. It was free then,
   about 6 months ago. It is a fun wordgame, if you like word games. It
   gives you 6-7 letters per level and you try to make as many words as
   you can. They place the words that you have come up with in
   alphabetical order so you can see what you might be missing. I like
131it.                                                                      P
132How about lending or access to the local library?                        O
133How about lending or access to the local library?                        O

   stopped since. My husband said my wife perfers to go to bed with
142her Kindle instead of me he he. Phyllis                                  O

   Love mine so much I just bought another one for my husband so that
   I can have my own all to myself. I use it for many, many things other
145than e-book reading, although it excels at that.                         P
   I love my Kindle, and its not even one of the new ones! Just love to
146read anything anywhere...                                                P

   Love love love my kindle! It has made reading psych articles for
   dissertation much more convenient. I have also rediscovered that I
153like reading books for pleasure - who knew?                              P
154I do know how to do that!                                                O

   song???? Only slightly plagarized.....Kindle, I think I love you, so
   what was I so afraid of, you only want to make me happy, so if you
   say, hey, go away I will, but I think better still I better stay around and
   love you. do you think I have a case? let me ask you to your face?
158do you think you love me? I THINK I LOVE YOU!                              P
   I was having a problem with my Kindle, where it kept freezing up on
   me. I mean every time I went to read, I had to defreeze it. I was
   starting to get worried - was I going to have to deal with this or did I
   have a defected Kindle. So I finally called for help again - I wanted to
   enjoy my reading time. I explained my problem, and sure enough,
   there was a problem - it was the type of cover I purchased, I guess it
   messes it up somehow. So they kindly refunded my purchase and I
   bought a different one and it was the best fix ever. I no longer have
159any problems - I truly love my Kindle.                                     P
   My kindle was a late Christmas gift to myself. I truly believe is the
   greatest invention since peanut butter. Not overly complicated or
   overly pretentious. Sexy in its simplicity, elegant in its usefulness. I
160love my kindle                                                            P
   My kindle froze and when I rebooted everything in my archives was
161gone. Is that a problem from that last update? :(                         N
   I LOVE my Kindle!! Easy to read and take anywhere!! I have read
   some really great books lately! Right now reading Kelly Cutrones
162book! Love it!!                                                           P
163Love love my Kindle !!! Never never leave home without it.                P
164I like my kindle!!!!                                                      P

   I bought myself a kindle for Christmas . I bought 2 books, the other
166are free ones and I have 41 books . Love it                               P
   I love my kindle, the ability to change fonts, look up words in the
   dictionary, make notes and did I mention my favorite, text to speech
   for my 1 hour commute. I dont have to put my book down, I just let it
167read to me. I LOVE IT!!!!!                                                P
   My Kindle is GREAT at the gym. Set the treadmill for one hour, turn
168on my Kindle and before I know it, times up! Its the best!                P
   My Kindle was a Christmas gift from my daughters and their
   husbands. I LOVE it!!! I take it everywhere. Its so much easier to
   always have with me than a book. I have arthritis in my hands and
   the Kindle does not hurt them when I hold it. I can lay it down to read
   and the pages dont flop open:) Im reading a greater variety of books
   and enjoy the Word Search game. Plan to get Scrabble soon. Its
   one of the best gifts Ive received!! I really appreciate the updates
169and instructions posted on fb.                                            P

174I love my Kindle so much, I snuggle with it every night.                  P
   I have the 2nd generation but am thinking of getting the new one.
175Thoughts???                                                               O
   kindle in the waiting room at the docs office,kindle in the waiting
   room at the pharmacy, surrounded by nooks and kindles in waiting
176rooms these days. soooo convenient                                        P
177Im gonna gag.                                                             O
   Id like to teach the world to read, the perfect work of words, and ...,
178..., ..., .....                                                           P
   After buying our first Kindle about a year ago, we now have three in
   the family. Definitely the way to go for those who enjoy reading.
179Save the forests, buy a Kindle!                                           P
   I love my Kindle! Thanks Julie for giving it to me! My best ever gift!!!I
   love the free books that are available and I love the
   recommendations based on your book purchases! I take my Kindle
   everywhere and I especially love it for traveling and holidays! Give a
   Kindle to someone you love or encourage a child to read more by
180giving them a Kindle! It will get them excited about reading!             P
181l would so like to share the books ive purchased with my friends.... P
   How do you download and play games on Kindle? I didnt know you
182could do this!                                                            O
   can someone tell me.when you use the web...is it in color like the
183nook??                                                                    P
   louise - you buy them from the amazon store. Theyre currently only
184available in the us which leaves the rest of the world waiting            O
185No                                                                        O
   How do we lobby for cheaper ebooks? Saw new book advertised
   yesterday at train station for £3.49 in a shop and went to Kindle
186store and it was £9.99! Quite a difference......                          P
   I order this week and am SO excited. Spent weeks picking out my
187cover choices etc.                                                        P
   Well thats not fair! Come on Amazon - the rest of the world wants to
188play games too!                                                           P
189:) I did write a song :) I love my kindle! Lol                            P
   My wife got me the Kindle dx for Valentines since I read a lot..I just
   love it, where ever I go it goes with me.I warp into another world as I
190start reading..n Kindle really doesnt get in the way!! Totally floored..:)P
   One of our local schools in the County is looking into using Kindles
   in the classroom for every student! WOW! They say it would be
191cheaper than expensive Textbooks and could save money!                    P
   I carry my Kindly in my purse next to my cell phone. Would not be
   without it. It is the best gadget I ever owned (second to it is my
   Keurig coffee maker). K and K, Kindle and coffee, what could be
192better.                                                                   P
   Lets all try to persuade Kindle to allow us to download snooks from
   our local Libraries. Your Library may not provide this facility now but
   it will, I believe, very soon. Be prepared. Meanwhile check out the
   Overdrive Media Console app. With this you can access your Library
   and download snooks and audio books to your iPod
   touch/pad/phone etc. I still prefer my Kindle so come on Kindle, be
193good to us!                                                               P
194ebooks not snooks.                                                        O
195And then you could download it to your Kindle and listen to it!           O
   I would love to love a Kindle but it needs to be library ebook friendly
196first :(                                                                  N
   I like my Kindle but miss having a backlight so I can read in the dark.
   Also, I use my eyes all day at a computer so lately Ive been doing a
197lot more audio books on my smartphone.                                    N
   I love my Kindle. I have the K2 but thinking about upgrading to the
198new model. .                                                              P
   I love it because the Kindle has made it easy for me to always have
199a book to read, and has allowed me to self-publish too!                   P
   My kindles screen has disappeared actually only the top half. I miss
200it dearly> (                                                              N
201It happened right after the update>                                       O
202Love my kindle! Big entertainment in a little package!!! Thanks!<3        P
203Read on my kindle. Thats what I do.                                       O
   I love my kindle. Being full time RVers its a must, its the only way to
   travel and read without having books everywhere. Anyone who
   travel in a motorhome knows there isnt a whole lot of room for
204books. My kindle is the best.                                             P
   I love my Kindle but hope one day soon I can upgrade to a color
   version so I can download magazines in all their glory. I also love all
   the games (some free and some very reasonably priced) that I can
   play when I am not reading. I still buy a few paper books but the
205Kindle is so much easier to read in bed.                                  P
206Best thing since slice bread!!! LOL                                       P
   ♫ I love my Kindle...my only Kindle...it makes me happy... when
   skies are grey...I read more often... now that I have it...please dont
207take my Kindle away!... TaDa!                                             P
   Wherever I go my Kindle goes with mne..Im so happy my daughter
208introduced me to it.                                                      P
   I LOVE my Kindle! Were a family of 6 who are worldschooling and
   travelling slowly around the world since Oct10. The BEST
   investment for our travel lifestyle, and an essential travel gear! We
   have our travel guide books, homeschooling books, and novels with
   us in our Kindle. We use it more than twice a day. The only negative
   thing weve experienced is that we all have to wait to take our turn
209reading the Kindle....Well need to pick up another one this fall.         P
   There are a lot of things in this world I could live without. My Kindle
210doesnt happen to be one of them!                                          O
211Kindle video poker - excellent! Its cutting in to my reading time:)       P
212I love my Kindle! I wouldnt exchange it for anything in this world!       P
   I love my Kindle! I not only read more but I also love the word search
213books for the Kindle. I would never purchase another e-reader.            P
214I so agree. I just love my Kindle                                         P
   Amazon should step up to the plate and do an update so public
   library books can be (borrowed) downloaded to the kindle. It would
215be nice to be able to get books from Nassau County Librays                P
   I just read Madam Tussaud by Michelle Moran. Historical Fiction
216gebre. Excellent read!                                                    P

   What happened to the authors names in the lists? Not very useful to
221try to read the authors name from the thumbnail book cover.          P

   Just received a new Kindle but I dont have wifi internet,and I still cant
   get the brand new router I bought to work. I have 1 little book on my
   Kindle that I downloaded,and that took me 30 minutes to try to get
   load into the Kindle. I would love to enjoy my Kindle as much as
   everyone else is,but it has not been as effortless for me as for them :

   I Love my Kindle. I like trying out the Free Books, BUT, your Free
   Books selections are POOR! And the Free Book Section is Not
   Updated Hourly! I paid for my Kindle, So I do wish that the price of
   the Kindle books were reduced for Kindle owners!!!Kindle, How
231about a response to this.                                                P
   How about reduced prices on kindle books , for Kindle Owners, say
232once a month!                                                            O
233@Linda there are other venues to find great free books if you look. P
   Love the Kindle best gift ever. Take it everywhere with me. Love the
234free books also                                                          P
   I just got an iPhone4, and im loving the Kindle Store app and the
235alerts here....so convenient!                                            P
236Best gift I ever gave myself! ; )                                        P
   I have found a lot of good free Kindle books. You have to check
   regularly; as some are only free for a very limited time, then back to
   regular price. One thing I dont like is that Ive noticed that lately the
   Kindle purchase price is MORE EXPENSIVE than the actual book!
237In that case, I will buy the real book. Duh?                             P
   Leslie, download to your computer then connect the kindle via usb
   and copy the book from the computer into the documents folder on
   your kindle. Thats what I had to do out here in the boonies! Works
238great and you have an extra backup on your computer.                     P
   Perfect timing for this post, got a lot of snow coming and the power is
239sure to go out so I picked up 2 more books off the list....thanks        P
   @Annette. I agree. It really makes me angry when the Kindle book is
   more than the actual book. I refuse to buy either. That is the ONLY
   problem that I have with Amazon. It is something they should adjust
240immediately.                                                             N
241Too bad I cant open this link on my Kindle.                              N
   LOVE LOVE LOVE my Kindle and the free books are great. Have
242never enjoyed reading so much.                                           P
   I agree w/ Annette... I love my Kindle, am willing to pay for certain
   books but pretty bummed that often the Kindle edition is more
   expensive than the actual book! This doesnt make much sense &
   disappoints every time I notice it. Otherwise yes there are great
243resources for free books...                                              P
244And my book: ALOHA RAINBOW.                                              O
245Try The Hangmans Daughter !                                              O
   Amazon does not control the price the publisher does and they need
   to make a certain amount per unit because contractually, everyone
   involved was promised a certain percentage per unit. Libraries still
   exist so if you dont like the price, go check it out for free. Also many
246librarys have free downloads to borrow on their websites.                P
247Love love love my Kindle!!!!!!!!!                                        P
248Still reading "Anna Karenina"...long,but good.                           P
    I do buy my fair share of paid Kindle books, but itd be nice if the
    Android and iPod Touch Kindle apps would let us browse the top
    FREE books from within the apps themselves. Hope this is a coming
249upgrade.                                                                   P
    I love my kindle and the free books are fantastic. Some I read as a
    teenager... and it is great to reread them as a mature adult.
250Especially when they are free!                                             P
    Found some good freebies today... gotta love it... and love the
251Kindle!                                                                    P
252Thanks for posting this! I found me 5 freebies!!!!                         O
    Just be careful if youre shopping in the "free" list. Amazon has been
    slipping "paid" books in there (hoping youll get caught up in the
    shopping and "accidently" buy one you have to pay for?) Still LOVE
    my Kindle!
253                                                                           P
254Yay! Free books! I got 8 of em! Woo hoo!                                   P
255Wow! Just downloaded 10 free books. Sweet!                                 P
256checked it out last night - downloaded at least a dozen more titles! O
257Thanks for the link to free books!                                         P
258I love this option! Using it is how I have found all of my books, so far! P
    Me and my two young daughters all received kindles at Christmas!
    They read with them constantly!!! I so wish I could afford to buy each
    child in their 2nd & 4th grade class one!! It would also be an
    awesome fund raiser to raise money to purchase these for
    retirement homes!! I loved reading as a child and the kindle is an
259awesome way to spark kids interest in reading!                             P
260Alladin, duh                                                               O
261Love this feature!!!!!!                                                    P
    Love the kindle and it makes you want to read all the time:-) Also, if
    someone doesnt have wifi at home, go to local hotspot (every town
    has a coffee shop) and download a bunch of books at once. Or just
262go anywhere with wifi and start downloading..                              P
263I love free books!                                                         P
    Love the free books. Im reading new authors whos books I have
264never read before! I love my kindle!!                                      P
    I accidentally downloaded a book that was in the free section but
    wasnt free. I called and it was removed immediately. They were very
265apologetic and Im sure it was an oversight. I love my Kindle.              P
266Got 7 - luv free books!                                                    P
267could not get the new download to download....                             O
    Most public libraries lend e-books; however, the libraries format is
268NOT compatible with the Amazon Kindle. Big bummer!                         O
    I know this is off topic but I cant say enough about the qualtity and
269helpfullness of Kindle support.                                            P
    I read at least 3 books a week so the free books are wonderful. If iI
    find it boring after a chapter or two, I delete it and get another. Since
270it was free I dont feel bad about deleting.                                O
271I absolutely LOVE my Kindle                                                P
272KINDLE KEEPS ROCKING, I KEEP READING.                                      O
    Is there a buy back program for people to up-grade? I was hoping to
    pick up a "gently used" kindle for my teenager. She is starting to
    think reading is fun while reading Shakespeare and I want my kindle
273back!                                                                      P
    I love the kindle.. I dont know why I was fighting against getting one
    for so long. My husband got it for me with the wifi and 3g so I can
    download more when I want. I Love the free books. I have
    downloaded roughly 90 books and only paid $7.00 total so far on
    books that were must haves. I like having a variety so that if I am not
    that interested in a book I can choose another without going to the
    site. I can always try that book again later. This is fun. I am reading
    again for the first time in a long long long time. Thank you Kindle for
    finding a way that I can enjoy books now. This coming from someone
274who never enjoyed any reading at all due to a mild case of dyslexia. P
275This is going to be dangerous to my credit card, isnt it?                  N
    @ Leslie Cyr - Leslie have you tried downloading via your USB
    cable? You should be able to do that. Right, Kindle Users?! Shouldnt
    she be able to download via the USB whether she has WiFi or not?
276Book to>>computer>>Kindle. Help a fellow Kindle user out! :)               P
    Love my Kindle. I have bought a lot of books and also downloaded
    quite a few free books. My daughter has a Kindle and we did the
    lending a book option. Not all your books on Kindle are lendable so
277you need the check. Everyone keep reading.                                 P
   Yep, its totally doable to download books to your computer than
   transfer to the Kindle via the USB cable. People without wireless
   coverage have been doing it all along. Directions are in the Kindle
   Users Guide.Also, folks who think Kindle book prices should be
   lower should talk to the publishers - theyre the ones who set the
   prices, especially the higher ones (youll note that on many books its
278noted that "This price was set by the publisher").                        O
   Thnx for this post I just downloaded 12 new books for free! I love my
279Kindle my best travel companion :))                                       P
   I love the old Classics (especially the FREE download). Just finished
   reading The Count of Monte Cristo and now into Uncle Toms Cabin.
280Hooray for Kindle!                                                        P
281Love my kindle, my children got me this for my birthday last year.        P
   My hubby got me a kindle and I love it!!. I can read books,
   magazines, etc..If you love to read this is definately something you
282should look into.                                                         P
   Thanks. Just downloaded 23 books. That will keep me busy for a
283while. LOL                                                                P
284I love kindle and love Nook color and bw nook. I enjoy 3 of them.         P
   In order for this to be really useful to me, you need to give me a way
   to sort for similar tastes, like Netflix does, for instance. Popular does
285not impress me.                                                           P
286i am reading aesop fables                                                 O
   @ Leslie, try going to a Starbucks or Panera Bread where wifi is
   free. Go to menu button and make sure wifi is turned on. Now go to
   shop kindle book store or NY times best sellers and start enjoying
   your kindle like the rest of us. Also you can type in your own
287selection. Hope this helps. Good Luck                                     P
   After less than a year we are addicted to our Kindles. We each have
   one so we sometimes trade. We have read 87 books since we
   started. We dont have TV in our bedroom and go to bed at 9:00 and
   read til 11:00. It is so easy to hold and easy to order new books and
288read immediately. Easy to transport. Wonderful!                           P
289Thank you!                                                                P

292be ecstatic!                                                              O
   I love this collection feature. I use it and really does help me find
293things quickly.                                                           P

294Droid? I cant find this info anywhere. :(                                 N

295which I was hoping to never catch sight of again!                         N

300omg, im 12,and i flippin adore my kindle!!!<3 <3 <3 <3                    P
   I use this feature, have a collection of classics I read with my
   homeschool students, and one for different genres just for myself.
301Keeps me down to 2 pages rather than 18 or so.                            O
302I am glad to finally know how to do this!                                 P
   Thanks for that tip, I knew there HAD to be a way to do it but I was
303at a loss as to how.                                                      N
   I have moved things to a collection but they still show as individual
   items too. Am I missing something? I would like to house my stuff in
304collections not both.                                                     P
305@Ginger KL: that would be GREAT :D                                        P
   Melodie - how are you moving them? Do you use the 5-way thing to
   hilite "add to collection" and then choose the collection? Thats the
   way I do it and the book always disappears from home and only
306appears in the collection.                                                O
   Anyone know how to remove a free sample permanently? Lets just
307say Im glad I got the sample.                                             P
308I have the same issue as Melodie...                                       N
   @Melodie - at the top of your screen, you need to tell it to sort by
309collections. Not by author, or most recent, or whatever.                  O
   @ Frances - you should be able to click left when its highlighted and
310that should give you the option to delete.                                O
    I have a similar wish to Ginger. Id like to be able to put books into
    more than one collection. eg - Jane Eyre would be in Classic Novels,
311and Favourites.                                                            P
312Thanks!                                                                    O
    Janice - You can do that. You just cant have collections inside of
    collections. But you can send a book to as many collections as you
313like.                                                                      P

314like.                                                                      P
    @Ann - to remove from my droid I just press and hold on the book
    title until a box opens and it will have some options. One is to
315remove from device. Hope this helps you!                                   O
    I have trouble getting things back into archive. Anyone know if I can
    keep both Kindles linked to the same Amazon account, but only
    have books go to one of them and not archive in the other? I want to
    get some stuff that my 14 year old son doesnt want/need in his
316archive and vice versa.                                                    N
    Any idea how to put a nook on the kindle from my computer? I have
    one on a disc into the computer and want to put on my kindle.
    How??

    Wish I could manage collections from Manage My Kindle and from
318Kindle for PC.                                                             O
319Finally! Thanks!                                                           O

    I would just like to know how to put books I have already read into
322the archives. I read the instruction guide but could not find that.        P
    - Home page by CollectionUse your five way button move the cursor
    to the top of you home screen hit the right directional button and sort
    your Home page by Collection. This will allow your Kindle to only
    display your books once (Collections & books on Home page). When
    you enter a collection you will only be shown the books in that
323collection.                                                                O

326Great.                                                                     P

    - Karen, Im guessing you mean book and not nook. The nook and
    the Kindle dont interface.For a book, use your USB cable that came
    with the Kindle and attach it to you computer and reader. Assuming
    here that you have a PC go to My Computer folder on your desktop
    and you should see a Kindle icon as if it was a USB flash drive or
    some other type of attached device. Select the Kindle supported
    file(s) you have in your PC and drop them on the icon. The files are
328now on your Kindle.                                                        O
    The big question is, how do I get rid of the samples once Ive bought
329the book?                                                                  N
330The nook :( the kindle :)                                                  O
    My Kindle is charged, but when I try to turn it on the green light
    comes on for a few seconds but will not come on. I just got this in
331Sept. New edition Kindle.                                                  O
332Thanks, I was wondering!                                                   O
333I LOVE this!! Thank you.                                                   P
    but how do I put into the archives when I am done reading? no one
334has been able to answer me that.                                           O
335I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                           P
    But what about Kindle content that no longer shows up in "your
    orders" because they were purchased so long ago??? I want to
336delete some of those books. Please advise. Thank you.                      P
    @Sarah, if you highlight the title and then click to the right, one of the
    options will be "remove from this device". That puts it in archives.
    @Traepischke , highlight the title of the sample and then click to the
337right and choose "delete"                                                  P
    Yes! I love the create a collection feature. It makes it easier to find
    your books. Plus you can keep up better with what you have read if
338you have books iin all types of categories.                                P
    How come this Does Not work for ALL books? I still have 5 stuck on
339my kindle in Arcives grrrr                                                 O
   @Theri I have the same problem and cant figure it out either. The
   older books are archived but are not listed anywhere when I go
340online to manage your kindle. They do not show up at all.                N
   To delete a sample after purchasing the book: highlight the sample
   on the Home page, rift select with the 5-way and select delete. This
341permanently deleted the sample.                                          O
342Thank God!                                                               P
   OMG! I just had a friend do this for me because I didnt have time to
   look it up. Kinda scary... are you monitoring me Kindle? Are you
   going to rule the world through mind reading? ;-) Im calling for govt
343restrictions here *tongue-in-cheek* Im really tired...                   N
344Thanks. Ive been wondering about how to do that...                       O
   My kindle just received some type of update. Anyone know what this
345is?                                                                      O
346I wanna know how to move something TO the archived items....??? O
347thanks for the tip i know there had to be way                            O
348doesnt work on all files...                                              O
   Is it possible to have Amazon e-mail these tips to us? It sure would
349be a help to me. :-)                                                     P
350Im glad they finally told us how to do this!                             P
   Yeah same problem here, it leaves some kind of link to the title you
   place in a collection, but I dont think two actual copies are stored, but
   access to same book via main menu and the collection you really
351wish it would show up and no where else!! : ) still love ya, Kindle! ; ) O
   I think it would be helpful if we could create our collections in
   Manage Your Kindle......then as we purchases them, we can move
352them into their correct collection.....                                  P
353LOVE MY KINDLE!!                                                         P
   I would like to be able to sub-categorize my collections. Also is there
   a way to search for only kindle audio books in the store? I would like
354to try an audio book on my kindle.                                       P
   Fml I never knew what collections were for. And I actually read the
355while PDF on my kindle, lol                                              O
   If youve deleted a book through the Manage Your Kindle page and
   its still in your Archives, its probably because you havent turned on
   wireless since you deleted. Your Kindle wont know its been
356permanently deleted until it can "talk to the mothership".               O
   is there any way to alphabetize the collections on my Kindle? that
357would sure make searching easy!                                          P
358Cant believe how much I love my Kindle!!                                 P
   how about when you delete from "Manage your kindle" and they still
   show up on the kindle??? I called Amazon this week - tech had no
   clue - deregistered my kindle and re-registered - told me hed look
   into it and call me back - its been almost a week - no call or anything.
   I LOVE my Kindle, but its annoying to want something gone and cant
359get rid of it.                                                           N
   I saw the other day on FB we were to get a download when it went
360into sleep mode - if I did - no clue as to how/what or where.            O
   Does anyone still read the original Kindle? I still really like mine
   although I dont think I can play games on it. Thats what the
361computer is for!                                                         O
362My Kindle just got the upgrade, yippee! Page numbers at last!            O
   to Janice, you should have received an email about the update with
363a link to detailed instructions.                                         O
   Lori W.M. - Ive had this problem too! I deleted titles from "Manage
   your Kindle" and not only did they continue to show up in my
   archived items, still available to download, but when I purchased a
   new Kindle, the deleted title showed up in my archives there too!
   When I installed Kindle for PC, the deleted title again showed up in
   my archives. The deleted title is no longer showing in "Manage your
   Kindle" but it wont go away from my archives! Yuck! Am I stuck
364forever with a bad story that I would rather forget?                     N
   Nice, but will it help us download ebooks from other sources?
   Mainers are still waiting for Kindle to adopt the technology that
   others have so people can download books through the state library
   website. Hey, Amazon, Im a public library director and even though I
   love my Kindle, Im buying 2 or 3 Nooks next week for my library....no
365Kindles. Sorry!                                                          P
   That deletes it from the account too? :| I was just trying to get rid of
366stuff from the device.. Crap.                                            N
   - Janice To see what version of the operating system that your
   Kindle has on it go to your Home screen, press the Menu button,
   select System, at the bottom right you will see the version number. It
   will be something like 3.0.2 (xxxxxxx). If your Kindle has the new OS
367it will read 3.1                                                         P
   Agreed collections contain books, but the books are also contained
   outside of the collection folders, what then is the point of making a
368collection in the first place.                                          O
   - Robyn CombsIf you look at the bottom of your Kindle there is a
   small hole. This is a microphone, it is mentioned in the Users
369Manual. Ill let you figure out the rest of the answer to your question. O
   I have many collection folders. Fav authors, classics, free downloads
   to try, books Reading, books read and info books. Its a lot easier to
   locate your books.To make a collection high light book then use the
   square button and press right side to move sideways. Then make a
370collection. Hope this helps                                             P
   Thank you so much for the very helpful instructions you post. I am
371learning more about my Kindle every time I read a post.                 P
   Thank you for your explanation of Kindle. I understood it. To Mr
372Joseph                                                                  P
   I love my Kindle, but I really wish there was a way to manage my
   collections from the PC - its very tedious and time-consuming fiddling
373around with the buttons on the Kindle itself.                           O
   I also have the same problem of deleted books still showing up in
   the archived items....and I have had my Kindle turned on wi-fi since
374they were deleted.                                                      N
   1 is a sample No I dont want the book! The others were free books I
   dont want. YES I had my WiFi on! I tried EVERYTING to get rid of
375these books!                                                            O

376Thanks - this is a great tip!                                            P
377Thanks, thats just what Id been trying to find out how to do.            O
   Sabah Farheen Hasan, you have your books in the wrong order. If
   you go to the home page and with the five way go up to the very top
   it will come up and say "Title, Author, Collections and Most Recent
   First", if you put the highlight under Collections then the books will
378only show up in the collections. Hope that helps!!!                      O
   Love this feature as I read so many different types of books. I have
   crochete, cook books, self help, samples to be read, etc. Kindle just
379keeps getting better. I have two.                                        P
380it is sooooo awesome.                                                    P
   To the person who wanted audio books, you have already got them.
   If you are in your book and you push the change font button it will
   show you a few different things and one of those things is called "text
   to speech" , most of our books are enabled to have this all you have
381to do is turn it on!! Hope I didnt just confuse you more!!!              O
382? how to move something to the archived items list?                      O
   OK I did all this and the books r still in my Archive-I want them outa
   there -they r gone from my orders section on amazon but still in my
383kindle -they didnt go away-Why??                                         O
384So how do you delete a document you have sent to your kindle?            O
   Why not just have a bin folder and put all unwanted books in there
   and dont look at them again after all the kindle holds 3500 books.
   Forget the ones you dont want and spend your time on the ones you
385do want                                                                  N
   One evening I forgot my Kindle at the office andI had to read one of
   my 1900 plus books. Do you believe that I needed two hands to turn
386the pages?                                                               O

   I also made my own cover and it has bright flower and polka dots
   and everyone in the office wants me to make them one too. Oh it

398I got this case for my husbands K3 and he really likes it.                P
   Nice... was looking to get a cover. Would buy Amazons, but am
399vegan, so dont want leather... thanks.                                    P
   Does anyone know of a sleeve that can fit the Kindle latest
   generation with the Kindle lighted cover in it? I put it in my purse and
400crumbs or dirt can still get in or on the kindle!! Thanks!                N
401I want 1!!!!!!! <3                                                        O
402I have this as well ... and I just love it!                               P
403I have this cover and it works great. Loud when you open it though. P
404I have this one too. Jeffs right -- it is loud, but its a great cover.    P
405I use this; it works for me. I throw it in my backpack.                   O
   very nice but since I have the Amazon Kindle app (awesome) on my
406EVO I wonder if it would fit that?? Hmm                                   P
407I have it and the flap is too big. Kind of pricey.                        O
408Works great. Looks great.                                                 P
   I wonder if amazon will give me credit for the cover I bought with my
409Kindle that makes it "glitchy"?                                           P
   I have the nylon one and love it! Doesnt seem too bulky; it still fits in
410the outside pocket of my purse.                                           P
411I think $30 is about $20 too much.                                        O
   I almost bought this one, but went with the M-Edge case and light
412that fits in the case. Love it.                                           P
413This is what I use... and LOVE IT.                                        P
414This is the one I have. Love it!!                                         P

415Why cant they makle a cover that is not reasonably priced.              P
416i like it but with shipping its $60 not paying that!!                   P
   I have the BUILT Nuprene and its a amazing, I didnt want a zipper to
   scratch the kindle, and i didnt want velcro cause it makes too much
   noise and eventually they get old and dont work that well...This is the
417best thing since sliced bread!                                          P
   Just buy a Belkin. Its the same thing, but with a zipper. I bought mine
418at Target for around $20.                                               O
419I have this one! Violet and Barley. Love it!                            P
420Love mine! Worth the money.                                             P
   @David Noooo kidding. You would think that competition would
421bring the price down to earth.                                          O
422LOVE MINE!!!!                                                           P
423nice of you to promote other peoples cases                              P
   I have one and love it!! Mine is in the camaflage tones though with
424pink binding - easy to spot when I put it down!                         P
425The kindle used to come with a free case...just sayin.                  P
   I love all things Timbuk2. Own several bags, including a Kindle
426sleeve.                                                                 P
   My Kindle Timbuk 2 sleeve only came to $24 w/shipping. ?? It is
427perfect - padded and just what I wanted.                                P
428I can probably sew one of these! Thanks for the idea!                   O
429whats wrong with Amazons Own cover??                                    N
430This is a great sleeve.                                                 P
   My sister sewed me a Kindle sleeve much cuter (and cheaper) than
431this.                                                                   P
   No offense but all the sleeves for this product are a bit ugly. Cant
432beat my lighted green leather case!                                     N
433I love mine!                                                            P
   Was trying to manually download updates and had to call your
   service for help! The guy was inpatient-bordering on rude, could
   NOT understand him! I told him I was having trouble understanding
   what he was saying! I finally got the problem solved but next time I
434will hang up until I get someone that speaks ENGLISH!!                  N
   I bought one a few months ago and LOVE it! I feel safe just tossing it
   into my backpack with all my textbooks, and Im confident my Kindle
435is protected. :) Great product!                                         P
   Im intrigued I must say... I already have a case but this might be a
436good backup for rainy days.                                             P
   I won one of these and its really nice! Too bad I actually own a 2nd
437generation Kindle that wont fit in it.                                  O
   Ive had the black version of the sleeve for about 14 mos. Love it. I
   dropped the sleeve with Kindle in it in the water while boarding our
   sailboat. It floated, and when it was fished out after about 4 min., it
438was bone dry inside!                                                    P
   Amen. Same thing happened to me twice. If I wanted to speak
   another language I would move. Its aggravating when something is
   not working, then to have to try to understand someone else try to
439explain how to fix it, not speak English.                               O

   Have and love mine. I much prefer reading naked (without the book
441like cover)                                                                   P
442already have it and love it!                                                  P
443Send me 1!!!                                                                  O
   @ Hayley Green- I put my Kindle lighted cover inside my Vera
   Bradley eBook cover. I have a black Amazon lighted and want a
   different color but Im waiting for them to go on sale (hint, hint
   Amazon!) I wanted something colorful on the outside. I look at it as
444extra protection from bangs and bumps.                                        P
445already have this one! love it                                                P
446Love mine, its awesome!                                                       P
   I bought my hubby a kindle, and this is the holder he got for it. Its
447great!                                                                        P
448I use the BUILT sleeve - no snaps, no zippers, no bulk. Perfect. JH P
449love that Timbuk2 I got for my kindle!                                        P
450I have one and dig it.                                                        O
451I have one also...the red and dark grey one...I love it                       P
452Can not buy it in Canada?                                                     O
   I love mine. The only thing is that when I bought it, they did not have
   much to choose from and I had to choose the "the less ugly" of the
   collection. But it is the best protection and it is not bulky. It fits in any
453of the purses I use perfectly.                                                P
454I love my Timbuk2 Case. I have it in black!                                   P
   This is the Timbuk2 case I purchased for my Kindle :) and I <3 the
455case and my Kindle :)                                                         P
   ok... how do I get rid of this now? No idea how it got there, no idea
456how to remove it. Im not an advert!                                           N
457Please remove. From my facebook thx                                           O
458I have one and love it                                                        P
459Just ordered mine!                                                            O
   What about a reasonably priced one for those of us with a 2nd
460generation Kindle.....come on guys!!                                          P
   I bought the red/gray/black one of these for my K3. Love it except for
   one thing: you have to take the Kindle out to charge it or read.
461Otherwise, its a great cover.                                                 P
   I have a leather cover that I got for $20 and it came with a funky
   printed skin and a screen protector at no charge. Love it. $24 with
462shipping.                                                                     P
463I have one from Gizmo Dorks & I love it!!!                                    P
464I love mine!                                                                  P
465I love mine!                                                                  P
   I much prefer the protective hard cover with the pull-out light in the
466corner.                                                                       P
467i like the covers that look like a book                                       P
   I have the larger version for the DX - the one major complaint is that
468the velcro is a bit loud when opening. Otherwise, its great.                  O
469Got mine. Love it.                                                            P
   I like my case with the built-in light. Its so great for reading in bed at
470night.                                                                        P
   I got one! Pink with camo!! Yeah baby. =) Very light and cute. Love
471it.                                                                           P
   I have this sleeve and I am very happy with it. Because of the
   memory foam padding and the nylon water shedding material, a
   person would have to actually work to damage the Kindle inside. I
472prefer to use a sleeve because I read my Kindle when it is naked.             P
   This is so much superior to the Kindle leather case with the band
   that I bought in September for 39.99. The band lasted about two
   months, got loose then finally fell off. bought this for mine and my
   sons kindle and its much better. Re: help from amazon kindle, I
   always email and i have an answer usually within a few hours. thats
   the way to go. so far completely satisfied with customer service if i
473email.                                                                        P
474Own this. Live it                                                             O
475I love my Timbuk2.It even fits in my purse just perfect.                      P
   I bought the Timbuk2 when I got my Kindle3! I love it! Fits really nice
   in my purse! I just did not like to keep my Kindle in a case to read...
476defeats the light weight. It is a very nice case!                             P
477Great case! Very well made, and protects well.                                P
478I love mine.                                                                  P
479I have 3 covers - dress kindle to match my purse!                             O
480I have the green/gray one and love it!                                        P
481but are they made in America?                                               O
    If you dont want to see these messages on your FB wall, go back to
    the Amazon Kindle page, scroll down and click on "Unlike". You
482have to do it yourself.                                                     O
483Ive got one for my Kindle2. They make great stuff!                          P
    Today I bought a Vera Bradley Ebook Sleeve for my Kindle at the
    gift shop where I work. It is so beautiful, and it made me realize that
484my Kindle (which I love) needed a new suit.                                 P
485I just bought the lime one!!!                                               O
    Is anyone finding that Kindle doesnt like magnets? Like the kind that
    keep the flaps closed on my ipod and Blackberry cases? They cause
    my Kindle to reset itself or freeze. I wonder if their is a Kindle carrier
    that would provide more protection. Btw, my Kindle doesnt like static,
486either (...stupid down parka!)                                              P
    Can not understand why we in Canada can not buy these book
    covers some dumb excuse about the boarder. Funny one can buy
487just about anything without any trouble. What the h gives.???               N
    A friend just got me a "Tuf Luv" case for my Kindle! Read all about it!
    Stands the Kindle up in 3 positions so you can read it hands free!
488Neat!                                                                       O
489These are great !!                                                          P
490love you kindle....                                                         P
    I LOVE this sleeve. It fits in my purse, yet protects my kindle.... Nice
491looking too...                                                              P
492Are they coming out with one for the DX in the Kindle cover???              O
493I saw patterns to sew your own on Clotildes website.                        O
    Ive read some reviews that state the binding can be an issue...and
    to be honest the accessories for Kindles are just too expensive!
494                                                                            P
    $24.99 for a fabric sleeve??? This should be $10. I bet these cost $1
495to make if not less.                                                        O
496Have a Timbuk 2 for my Kindle 2 and have been very glad.                    P
497I have one of these and love it!                                            P
    Ive had this cover since October 2010 and have been very happy
498with it. Protects it from all the other stuff in the to go purse!           P
    I use a bubble wrap postage envelope, $0.79, though mine is
499repurposed and thus free!                                                   O
500Mine is awesome! I wouldnt have a Kindle without it.                        P
    I love my Timbuk2 sleeve for my Kindle. Fits perfect in my Timbuk2
    purse and goes with me everywhere. It fell out of my SUV yesterday
501and was protected. Yea!!                                                    P
    Anyone from South Africa who managed to get a cover for the
    Kindle 2 from Amazon? Love the Timbuk2 camo/pink/camo cover
502but there seems to be a problem with getting it here to me :(               P
    Excellent product! I dont worry about tossing my Kindle into my bag
503with the Timbuk2 Envelope Sleeve.                                           P
504Give me one please~                                                         O
505Why cant you ship these covers to B.C.?                                     O
506OMG....I cant believe how much of a tool you are!                           O

508I do the same thing!!!! :)                                                  P
509I do that too.                                                              O

511Boo to Who Views Your Profile.                                              O
512love MY KINDLE!                                                             P
    Your kindle specialists are a big help. One helped me with
    downloading new updates for my Kindle-Gen 2. Now it seems to be
513working a lot better. Thanks Jennifer E.                                    P
    I love to read, but hate lugging a book around (mine are usually the
    BIG ones), hate losing my bookmark, losing my place in the reading,
    and forgetting to bring another book if Im about done with the
    current one! And, sometimes time restraints can make getting to the
    book store a hassle.Now that my sweetheart got me a Kindle, I dont
514have to worry about any of that anymore!! :) I LOVE IT!!!                   N
515Since Christmas day, I have read 23 books on my Kindle...                   O
    I have fibromyalgia and RA, so when I want to read before bed, I can
516grab my Kindle and read with no pain in my hands.                           N
    I have been a kindle user for many yr. Have been stopped in
    restraunts and gave instructions on how it is used. next thing i know
517that person has bought one. I love my kindle.                               P
    I go and give platelets at the blood bank every two weeks, and I read
518my Kindle!!! It is my favorite thing in life!!!!                            P
519Totally relate to this post, Love my Kindle!!                               P
    Thats partly why we got ours! Expecting #2 in 5 weeks, and Im
520planning on reading one-handed while settling, breastfeeding, etc! O
521Me, too!                                                                O
522Did you get your update yet??                                           O
   I love my Kindle. I have some of the audio books so I can use it in
523the car.                                                                P
524I do that too                                                           O
   I LOVE my kindle. Absolute joy! Have had tendonitis in my hand and
   it was painful to hold a book. Now I can still enjoy reading and do it
525with one hand!                                                          P
526I agree completely!!! Happened just that way in my home today! :-) P
   I love the fact that it takes no effort to hold up my kindle, as
   compared to a 500-pg book, while laying in bed preparing for sleep.
   Its easily bookmarked and I know for sure my place is held until I
   wake Mr Kindle up! The print is so clear and my eyes dont get near
   as tired! I have returned to nightly reading after about 10 years on
527hold. THANK YOU, MR KINDLE!!                                            P
   My Kindle is my new constant companion. Love getting all the
528classics for free.                                                      P
   Good to see all of the positive posts..I just got mine yesterday. Was
   a bit bummed though, I wanted to purchase/DL a series of books and
529the 2nd one is not to be found...                                       P
530I use mine while nursing at night with the built in light. It is great! P
531I use mine while nursing at night with the built in light. It is great! P
   sew did Charles Darwin, read his Autobiography, before Amazon
532uses all the HARDCOPY for Kindle                                        O
   I wish I wouldve had mine when my baby was nursing; it wouldve
   made reading MUCH simpler and wouldve allowed me to do more
   than sit there completely bored when I was trying to minimize noise
533and keep it dark for middle-of-the-night feedings.                      N
534I do the same thing :)                                                  P
   i love my kindle. i had to get a new purse to so my kindle fit. now i
   can take it with me where ever. I read on the elliptical on the
   recumbrant and while waiting for my kids at school. I cant wait till
   Friday when i can use my kindle while waiting for our table to be
   ready at the resturant. We are a 2 kindle house. nice snuggling with
535my honey while we both read.                                              P
   i cant even read all of my Amazon self-published book..... Amazon
536controls access The Drive of Progress in Man                              P
537I do this with my son all the time.                                       O
538What built in light??? Thats my only complaint!!                          O
539ME TOO!! With a twin in each arm :)                                       P
   When Im fussy and unable to sleep (which, with stress, is often), I
   have my Kindle read to me! So much better than reading and putting
540down the book before Im truly ready to sleep.                             N
   I am still learning about my Kindle and deciding if I like it better than
541real books..                                                              P
   How come Nook geives its owner free Friday books? How about it
542Kindle????                                                                P
   I would have loved to have had my kindle while nursing and rocking
543sick babies! I LOVE my Kindle and tell everyone about them!               P
   Get a kindle, download books instead of buying them.....SAVE A
544TREE!                                                                     O
   Love my kindle! My 3 year old loves it too so santa brought her the
545vtech v reader and we hang out together reading our readers!              P
546How can i make the contrast darker on my kindle?                          N
   This is the whole reason I bought my kindle! I can feed and soothe
547my son while reading! Well worth the investment!                          P
548Really wish they had thia out 7 1/2 years ago..LOL                        P
   I have been trying to figure out a way to read a book and walk on my
   treadmill. Voila -- the Kindle makes it possible. Now, if I read my
   Kindle while walking the time passes so quickly -- Im not ready to
   get off the treadmill so quickly, I always have to read one more
549page, then one more again and so on.                                      O
550I did the samething with my Grandaughter                                  O
551I love kindle..thinking of getting the larger size!                       P
552I love my kindle too                                                      P
   I LOVE my kindle. Just got my awesome case w/ built in light
553yesterday! Love that too. =)                                              P
554I LOVE MY KINDLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                P
   I adore my Kindle. But I think its a pity Amazon dont disclose at
   purchase time the fact that they are going to refuse to see kindle
   books to non-American customers. In my country this would be
555misleading and deceptive conduct.                                         N
   those annoying babies just insisting on being held! how selfish of
556them.                                                                     N
   Love it!! I can hold my.children and read!!! Had it since v day
   2010...have read 94 books and.counting!!! It.goes everywhere with
557me!!                                                                       P
558Love my kindle. Fits in my purse and goes everywhere I go!                 P
   I do the same thing with my baby. Kindle saved my sanity as a new
559mom :)                                                                     P
   Love my Kindle! I am reading Fifth Avenue. It was either free or
   99cents. I have had my Kindle for 14 months. When I got it, the most
   expensive book was $9.99. I did not mind paying that for favorite
   authors. I have 4 favorite authors coming out with new books this
   Spring and they are all $14.99. So, I will order these from my library.
   Ken folletts book came out this winter,$19.99. Seriously?? Ordered it
   from the library. I know this is the publishers and not Amazon.
   Netflicks says it will not mail out dvds starting in 2 years. I can see in
   time, Authors going directly to ebook formats and leaving publishers
560in the dust.                                                               P
   im not in American and can download books with no problems, and
561so can my friends                                                          O
   I love my kindle, but... why cant a person hold a fussy baby with a
   book? Two kids, one who refused to sleep unless held, a good 10
562years before the kindle.                                                   O
   Hard copy til the day I die. That way books I paid for wont disappear
   from my library on someones whim ;)I refuse to pay for things that I
563dont truly own.                                                            N
   I love reading my kindle and holding my favorite other thing in the
564whole wide world, my baby grandaughter Riley, it is possible!              P
   I can relate to this post : ) I actually took a picture of me reading my
   "vintage" first gen. kindle with my baby sleeping in my arms and a
565kitty on the armrest of the chair we were in :)                            P
566Thats the reason I bought my kindle. :)                                    P
567I echo this statement. I thank god for kindle. I just wish it had a light P
568Me too!! Oh the joys of mommyhood ;-)                                      O
   @Kellie, get the cover with built in book. Works great. I got the red
569leather.                                                                   P
   I love my kindle. Have had it for several years. Can download quite a
570few free books                                                             P
   back in my day, I turned on music. Would have been glad to have
571had Kindles back then. LOL                                                 P
   You could have held her and read a book too. But I do love my
572Kindle!                                                                    P
   My son got me mine for my birthday. I was reluctant at first because
   I am a huge words on the page fan. Since I started using it, I cant put
   it down...on the treadmill, waiting in the dentists office, while
   watching tv...I love it and my son is thrilled because I told him its the
573best gift!                                                                 P
   Dave, your old fashioned attitude is to your own detriment....but I
   guess thats your choice! Why are you making comment on this post
574- you have to like kindle in order to do so??? How strange!                O
575@Kellie, built in book LIGHT! Left the most important part out!            P
   I read on my Kindle while donating blood platelets the other day. I
576LOVE my new toy!                                                           P
577I love my kindle!                                                          P
   That is my new favorite thing about my Kindle. I have read a lot in
578the 3 months since my son was born...wonderful!!!                          P
579I dont know why but I read faster with the kindle                          O
580My wife does the same, but with Nook and I with Kindle. :D                 P
581My wife does the same, but with Nook and I with Kindle. :D                 P
582Love my kindle!!!!                                                         P
583I ordered mine on Monday morning, cant wait!!                              O
   I never leave home without me Kindle. Never know when I might be
584stranded somewhere, or have a long wait. Great for buses too.              P
585Thats what I do!!                                                          O
   Im in a love affair with my kindle. And I want to decorate him with
586skins!                                                                     P
587I do that all the time :)                                                  P
   Marion, dont be jealous of nooks "Free Fridays". I have a nook as
   well as my Kindle. The Free Friday books are RARELY new free
   offerings, they almost always pick a book thats been free for a while
   already and spotlight it on Friday. Those of us who seek out the
   freebies dont get all excited on Fridays. On the whole Amazon offers
588a lot more freebies than B&N.                                              P
589My kindle is a real keeper!                                                O
   Yes, you can hold a paper book and a baby at the same time, but its
590a heck of a lot easier to hold & read a Kindle.                            P
591I wish I would have had one back in the day!!!                             O
   Does anyone know where I can enter to try to win a kindle,cant
592afford one,I really really really want a kindle!!!!                      P
   Yes me too. I wish Id had a Kindle while I was flying solo on fussy
593baby nights. :)                                                          N
594Nothing more perfect than a warm baby and warm snuggly baby.             P
   One of these works great on a Kindle and lets you hold it at a
   convenient angle hands-free, for only a few bucks:
595http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0045JNBNU                              P
   While flying today I held my friends sleeping baby in one arm and
   read with my kindle in the other. It makes turning the pages so much
596easier.                                                                  P
   While my kids watch Dora, I am indulging my Kindle fetish. I just
   LOVE my Kindle. My little girls love to help me, turn the page, while
597reading. Cant wait to try out some kids books, too.                      P
   While I like the Kindle in some situations, I have to say I managed to
   hold, rock and feed my kids just fine reading an actual book. I waited
   for them through sports practices and other activities with a book in
   hand or in my purse. The Kindle is a nice invention but I think the
   whole omission of books entirely has gotten out of hand. Are we
   suddenly incapable of turning a page but only dexterous enough to
   keep clicking an electronic tab? Its nice to have access to many
   books but I personally read only one at a time. I cant think of
598anywhere I cant bring along either my Kindle or a book.                  P
   Running on the treadmill goes by so much faster when I am reading
599my Kindle!                                                               P
   I agree, though sometimes she wakes up and asks me if I want to
600go antiquing tomorrow.                                                   O
   This also works if your 20 lb. cat insists on lap time! I can still read
601my mysteries!                                                            P
   I read so much now i need some new authors any suggestions I love
   Terri black stock Jodi picoult dannielle steel Sandra brown Karen
602kings bury any ideas                                                     P
603And she couldnt hold a paper book? Huh?!                                 O
   I too have fibromyalgia as well as osteoarthritis in my hands. It had
   literally gotten too painful to handle a book - since I got my kindle for
604christmas, Im able to finally do some reading. I love my kindle!          P
605That is sweet. Now, I want a baby to go with my Kindle.                   P
   My left arm is messed up from an accident (I am left handed). I
   practically had to give up reading which always has been my favorite
   pastime. Holding any book, keeping the pages opened hurt my arm
   really bad, it would ache and burn all the way up to my shoulder.
   Then one day I bought myself a Kindle and reading is no longer a
   pain. No more book to have to keep open, I dont even have to hold
606it. Yes, it is much different than holding onto a paperback               N
607Loving the text to speech program reading books fast                      P
   Love my kindle too & have the free kindle app on iPhone. Just have
608to sync whichever you go on & it updates to where you left off.           P
609KINDLE ROCKS THE CRADLE!!                                                 O
   No bookstore is open in the middle of the night, or has free books, or
   reviews 24/7! I will bet that some of u folks still use carbon paper:) Its
6102011 get with the times.                                                  P
   When I am on a crowded San Diego trolley I can hold on with one
611hand and hold on to my Kindle with the other and read!                    N
   when I was a teen, I read everyday. Then raising a family I quit
   reading. Now I have a Kindle and I am beginning to read a lot more. I
   really like having the ebooks better than paper books to have to find
612a place to store them.                                                    P
   I luvvvvvv my Kindle, that things stays in my purse cause I never
613know when Ill gt a chance to read. Best gift my sons ever gave me. P
   I think the people saying holding a paper book is just as easy as
   holding a kindle WHILE HOLDING A FUSSY BABY have not tried it
   both ways. My son will only nap on me and the Kindle makes it
   SOOO much easier. You can do it w/1 hand....not so easy w/ a thick
   book (especially turning pages). That is my FAVORITE part of
614owning a kindle bc my son is in my arms 24/7!!!                           P
615My son suggested that I download the Bible on my Kindle, I love it!! P
   My Kindle (which I got last Xmas) just went to Prague with me! It
616helps pass the time in the long airplane ride!                            O
   I got mine for valentines day..i love propping kindle @scott snider up
   against his back when we are in bed..easy page turning when we
617are spooning! Lol                                                         P
   When I am on my treadmill and cant hear TV because I am deaf, I
   can read my Kindle because I dont have turn hold a book and turn
618pages. Makes the 30 minutes fly by.                                       O
619I did the same thing yesterday!! could never do that with a book.         O
620Wish I had my kindle when my children were babies!                        O
621My little one is the same way. Thats why I love my kindle : )            P
   Who cares about a short power outage..I have my Kindle book light
622to show me the way in the dark......                                     O
   When my son was a tiny baby (long time ago....hes 30) and would
   have the occasional late night fussy spell, I would bundle him in a
   cozy blanket and rock him and read to him what ever book I
   happened to be reading at the time. The warmth and sound of the
   reading would always calm him down. As a result, hes always been
   a book lover. A Kindle can only make reading to or with an infant
623much easier......Read to your children........its sooooo important..... P
   I sit with my grandson after tucking him in and enjoy the quiet and
624my kindle!                                                               P
   I find my eyes hurt after looking at the kindle screen for very long. I
   bought the official kindle light and it reflects off it. I cant imagine
   anyone being so ill prepared that they require an electronic "book" to
   have reading material available and would be last minute trying to
   find an open bookstore in the middle of the night. I donate my books
   as I read them to the library and less fortunate people who would like
   to read and are not able to purchase the kindle or the e-books to
   load onto it. I had no trouble raising kids without a kindle. Whatever
   enhancements it can add to the experience do not negate books
   entirely. A child would rather page through a colorful book and enjoy
   going back and forth to favorite pictures than a one page colorless
   screen. It may be 2011 but that doesnt make kindle available to or
625right for everyone.                                                      P
626I do exactly the same thing... or play Every Word"                       O
   Its the bomb at the gym-easy to keep in place on a treadmill or
   elliptical-no more trying to prop it open with a towel! Its also so easy
   to turn pages. Recently I had an actual book while on a treadmill and
   found myself just touching the corner of a page and wondering why it
   didnt work--no wait this was a book with paper pages, I actually had
627to turn the page, not just touch one corner.                             P
   Here is my love declaration of the day : smoooooch my Kindle, you
628are the BEST !                                                           P
   My big issue is the grade of plastic used....it cracks without being
   forced in any way. Love Amazon for the gift vouchers and
629replacement though!                                                       N
630You could also read a book. Dont get me wrong, I love my Kindle. O
   Debbie no one forces you or others to purchase a kindle. I bought a
   $12 clip on light and it works fine. No reader wants to do away with
631books that are paper KINDLE offers another CHOICE.                        P
632do that all the time                                                      O
   Haha! I loved reading through these comments! I think what
   everyone is getting at - is that the Kindle shouldnt replace hard copy
   books entirely - it just provides a level of useflness that outdoes
   hard-copy books, hands down! Jogging on the treadmill, holding a
   baby, at the beach/in the water with a protective case, and then all
   the places and situations you could still read a regular book, but
   instead, youve got your WHOLE library, in 10oz and in one hand.
   Oh, not to mention you can bookmark, highlight, add notes, and you
   have a BUILT IN dictionary -- and you dont have to defile your book
   like you would your hard copy to put notes and highlights in. Hands
   down, the Kindle is better. How can anyone say it isnt better, when I
   can take my entire library, including my personal documents
   converted for free using my Kindle email/conversion process,
   everywhere I go - with a 3 week battery. I challenge anyone to carry
633your whole library with you for 3 weeks. Hehehehe!                        O
634Trying hard to save to get one!                                           N
   One of the best things I have ever bought,dont know how I managed
635without it                                                                P
   Why read a kindle forum/ fb page if you dont like or dont want a
   kindle?? Yes there r pros and cons for paper books and e books, but
   this is the KINDLE facebook site - if ur against kindle/ e book readers
636why r u bothering with this site?? Is it me??!                            N
   My oldest granddaughter saw a new paperback I just bought and
   asked "what is this? I thought you only read your Kindle." I laughed
637and told her it depended on price and which I could get cheaper.          O
   One of the better investments I made for myself. Plus I got to read
   my Nieces book, Wind In The Grasses Dancing. Check it out. Very
638afordable ! By Terrie McClay !!!!                                         P
   I read to my husband every night from my kindle 2. Its great, we get
   to enjoy books together, we talk about it during the day plus I have
   the app on my DROID so I just keep it updated and when were stuck
   at a Dr. Appt. I can quietly read to him. Its good for both of our brains
639plus its like we have our own private book club!                          P
640I am there                                                                O
   @Debbie: Id say the ease of managing kids & books at the same
   time depends on what sorts of books youre trying to read. Slim
   novels would be easy enough to manage, but I suspect itd be
   tougher with a giant, pointy-cornered hardback. One of the things I
   love about the Kindle is that I can be confident it will fit in my purse,
   no matter what the physical dimensions would be of the books Im
641reading.                                                                   P
   I love my Kindle beyond words! The only thing that would make it
   better would be letting us change the screensaver! Honestly, some
642of the pics are downright creepy.                                          P
   My Kindle goes to the Dr.s office(when we have to wait long periods
   of time), on road trips, to conferences, everywhere I go except work
   (I am so addicted I would not get much work done). It is lightweight
643and I can read it in brightest sun or by lamplight.                        N
   I received my Kindle as a gift from my husband. At first, I felt a little
   awkward, but it is one of the best gifts I have ever received. I love
644my Kindle.                                                                 P
    I received my Kindle as a gift and appreciate the thought. I have a
   large collection of books in my home, have always been an avid
   reader, and enjoy sharing and trading them. Its less expensive. The
   Kindle is good for travel or other situations where it may be easier
   than carrying a book. Im glad to see people actually discussing and
   sharing their ideas. Yes its the kindle site but Im not an amazon rep
   restricted to advertising the product and avoiding discussion of its
   pros and cons. It has many good points but theres room for
   improvement. This is a good place to voice concerns and
   suggestions from which other readers may benefit. For me, reading
   for too long off the kindle gives me a headache and the $12 clip on
   light mentioned by somebody causes glare on my screen and
   eyestrain despite angle adjustments. The effects are similar to
   staring at a computer screen at length. If anyone has suggestions on
   how to correct this, this forum is the place to do it. My eye doctor told
   me to limit or quit using the kindle and she said she hears the same
645complaint from patients often. Perhaps there is another alternative. P
   I got the first generation Kindle and loved and bought three more for
   the family. I just upgraded to the new Kindle WOW! Im never without
646it.                                                                        P
   I have a problem with my kindle. The top third of the screen is
647distorted and I cant read anything on the top third. What happended?N
   I laughed when a friend said what she like most about her Kindle - "I
   can sit at the kitchen table, read a book and pick up my coffee cup
648with the other hand. All at the same time!"                                P
   love my kindle can take it anywhere. its light weight and very
649convenit                                                                   P
650Love my Kindle...it goes everywhere                                        P
   Wow! I wish I could of posted a picture of my daughter and myself
   reading our kindles on a Mexico beach. We were there for 10 days
   and I finished 3 books. Glad I didnt have to pack those books with
   me! The best part is when reading a series I can go online to the
   authors website and find out which book is next. I still have a
651collection of books but I love my kindle:)                                 P
   There should be a slot for a Kindle right in front of the TV set so
   maybe that darn machine would be intimidated into giving us
652something we really want to see!                                           P
   My husband gave me one for Christmas and I absolutely LOVE it!
653He got me the 3G wiFi one.                                                 P
654Hmmm, cant hold a paperback as well ?                                      P
   Lois, its time to call Kindle customer service - 866-321-8851. If youre
   still under warranty theyll probably replace it even if you dropped it -
655if not they might offer you $75 towards a new Kindle.                      P
   I only had the Kindle since first of July and it has enabled me to read
   most of the historical books of the founders of this country for little or
656no cost. Kindle is a wonderful and bright new medium.                      P
   Everyone knows that I have been a Kindle fan for ages. I should be
   on the payroll, since Ive convinced dozens of my friends to buy their
   ereaders. When we are traveling out of the country, its great to have
657tons of books on my Kindle.                                                P
   I was soooo sitting in Starbucks this morning with a nursing/sleeping
658baby girl in my lap while reading my new novel on my Kindle. Love it!P
659My Kindle makes using the treadmill bearable!                              O
   going on the tredmill or bike really is great when I read on my kindle.
   I change the font to accomodate the distance and I go for nearly an
660hour without realizing it. Thank you kindle!                               P
661Well done on the new updates .... i like them a lot                        P
   The same is true when your cat wants some petting and you want to
662do a little reading.                                                       O
   They r great for moms w/ toddlers that get jealous + crinkle +rip
   pages out of PAPER books..+ for moms w/o sitters, it saves a trip to
663the bookstore w/ a tornado!                                               P
664Not to mention the space it saves in small homes.                         O
665Oh good to know. Thanks!                                                  P
666man, is there anything kindle CANT do?                                    O
   I LOVE that feature. Just wish it did better going online to facebook.
667Just impossible!                                                          P
668I LUV my Kindle....thank u Tara!!!!!!!                                    P
   I LOVE that about my Kindle, now I dont have to stop and find the
669word in the dictionary!                                                   P
670I love my Kindle. ;)                                                      P
671This is one of my favorite features and I use it all the time!            P
   i love this feature! I also use it to see if Im right when "guessing" the
672definition of a word. Very cool!                                          P
   I love this feature!!!!!!!!!Got my Kindle for Christmas and it was the
673best gift ever!!!!!                                                       P
674I love my Kindle too! :)                                                  P
675It really comes in handy!!!!                                              P
676How ironic! I was just using that today!                                  O
   Absolutely love my kindle. Wish I would of bought it sooner. But I
   waited and got the latest version. Those who love to read need to
677get one if they do not have one.                                          P
   nope, the kindle is great, now if i could just stay awake longer to read
678more.....love my kindle, best birthday present i ever bought myself P
   Ive gotten so used to this feature that I instinctively search for it
679when reading a normal printed book. And then I think "Aww shoot". O
680Best purchase I ever made:)                                               P
681another reason to get a kindle it seems.                                  O
   Thanks for the Tip!! That sure is going to help!! BTW I love my
682Kindle!                                                                   P
   YAYA no more having to stop reading and look it up in the diction on
683the kindle. Nice to know                                                  P
684Thanks for the tip, I just got my Kindle today...                         O
685Best gift my husband bought this christmas!!! I LOVE IT                   P
   I use the dictionary quite a bit. Dont know who uses some of these
686words. Love my kindle!!!                                                  P
   I luv the Kindle, but the reality of the dictionary is that when it is
   really needed it is useless. A native English speaker should need it
   for the most esoteric words, and they are the very ones about which
687the dictionary stays mum.                                                 O
   that tip does not work well with other languages btw. I installed a
   French dictionnary, but as soon as a word is plural, or feminine,
   instead of the standard entry in the dictionary, it no longer works.
688Very disappointing.                                                       P
689If only.the kindle was back lit!                                          O

   SUGGESTION TO KINDLE - Id love to have a translation option. I
   have a series of novels that Im reading in English but the setting is
   Italy. They throw in Italian words and I find that I have to look up
   some of them. It would be handle if I could scroll to the word and get
694a translation like I do a definition.                                     P
   This is one of my favorite things about the kindle...I love the
695dictionary function!                                                      P

   When kindle first came out. I thought I would never buy one because
   I liked holding a book. I love my kindle so does my hubby. When he
702is using it, I read on my phone.                                          P
   thats great.. I enjoy my kindle... its in the black cover with the light..
703(which works great.) It was a birthday gift..                              P
   I was reading a real book the other day & kept finding myself trying
704to highlight the word to look it up.....lol!                               P
705I love that feature.                                                       P
706Just tried it. Thanks for the tip.                                         O
   Customer Tip: Kindle TOUCH. While reading, you can see the
   definition of a word by TOUCHING it. If the word is in the dictionary,
   the definition will appear at the bottom of your screen. See how
707much easier those instructions are?                                        P
   I also change the default dictionary depending upon the book I am
   reading. The English dictionary for classic novels by Dickens or
708Doyle. American for contemporary novels by American writers.               P
709any way to use this feature on the Kindle for Android Ap?                  O

   love this feature. didnt realize how many words I just "tried" to define
713myself.                                                                    P
   one of the best gifts I have ever received, I love mine so much, we
714gave one to each son, <3                                                   P
715Dearly luv my K......had it for years now!!!                               P
   I love this on my ipad/iphone/computer kindle. I would not usually
   take the time to look up a word, Id just assume a meaning by what
   was around it and go on. Now, its so easy to tap it, and see the
716definition. Love it!                                                       P
   This is the one Kindle feature with the biggest gap between how cool
   it seems it would be (eh, it might be nice), and how cool it really
   turns out to be once you get used to using it (omg, how did I live
717without this).                                                             P
   Kat, while a touchscreen would be awesome, when you have a
   touchscreen its just one more thing to get scratched up and after
718awhile they do not work as well.                                           P
   I enjoy the dictionary feature so much that I missed it when I was
   reading a "book". I had to have the Kindle near me just to look up
719words I wasnt sure of.                                                     P
   The dictionary lookup feature is so helpful! Pretty sure I used that
   feature just today. :) I use my Kindle every single day and I am so
720glad I have it!                                                            P
721Trust me...i use this all the time!                                        P
722This is one of my favorite features!!!                                     P
   Thanks! I didnt k now that! I love these wonderful hints you all post.
723Keep them coming!                                                          P
   weirdly, I cannot get this feature to work if the word in question is the
724first one on the left hand margin side of the page.                        O
725...ours has been freezing up...???                                         N
726Love my Kindle!                                                            P
727Totally love my Kindle and the dictionary feature                          P
   When Im reading a physical book, there is often an embarrassing
   moment as I realize (after my thumb has already shifted on the page)
   that Im not reading my Kindle, and therefore cannot use the built-in
728dictionary.                                                                N
729Love this feature                                                          P
730I LOVE MY KINDLE !                                                         P
   This feature is the number one feature which has spoiled me. I
731seriously miss it when I read a paper book.                                N
732I love my Kindle                                                           P
733whoa!                                                                      O
   My. Favorite. Feature. Ever. I was reading a paperback (actual
   paper) last month and actually tried to move the nonexistent cursor
734to a word I wanted the definition of. LOL!                                 P
735One of my favorite features!                                               P
736well, that would not be an option on the very first Kindle, huh?           P
737Every day I am discovering things about my Kindle! Love it!                P
738One of my favorite features!!                                              P
739I still try to turn a page as In paperback, best thing Ive got, love it !! P
   I love this feature. I dont know how many times I wanted to know
740what a word meant but wouldnt get up to look it up in the dictionary. P
   @rick what edition. The older ones when they do that need to get rid
   of if newer contact amazon they will replace!!! Im buying my second
   one thats what 1st edition did wearing out. I read every day!!!! Use a
741lot. But thats what amazon told me.                                        O
742I use this feature often!!                                                 O
   I love this feature-I can read more technical books or special interest
   type and be able to understand the vocabulary. This would be a
   great tool in a classroom if every student had one. we can only
743dream of it happening!                                                  P
744Love all the little tips that are given :o)                             P
   Love my Kindle and what it can do!Love the text to speech especially
745when on the treadmill!!                                                 P
746I love this feature.                                                    P
747love love the dictionary                                                P
   I must say I do love this feature, if you are a Dean Koontz fan it is
748very necessary!                                                         P
   I use both dictionaries..if definition is not in the standard, then I
   switch to the Oxford. Also, use my Kindle to look up word definitions
749when reading paper books.                                               O
   I never really thought I would use that feature very much, but I use it
750all the time and I love it!                                             P
751We love the Kindle!!!                                                   P
752Can u do this with the kindle app on galaxy tab?                        O
   My Kindle makes me feel smart. I am forever looking using the built
   in dictionary. Every time I stumble across an unknown word, I have
753to find out the meaning. Love my Kindle -                               O
   Thats just one of the many things I like about the Kindle. Im loving
754mine.                                                                   P
755adoro mi kindle es mi nuevo juguete jajajaja                            O
   @ Rick, mine kept freezing up and I turn mine off or put it to sleep
   each time I need to put it down. I also make sure it is fully charged
   each day. I know I probably need to send it in but I dont want to give
756it up to do so. :)                                                      N
   Am not able to change my fonts for some reason. Cant get to that
757option, anyone have a clue why that would be?                           O
   I wish I could manage all my books on the Amazon site instead of
758having to remove each book one by one!                                  O
   I love this feature too! I was always taught to read a book with a
759dictionary! Now, its built right into the book! Life is good! :)        P
760I love this function!!                                                  P
   This feature is so useful... I am so fond of it that sometimes, while
   reading a physical book or brochure I try to use it then miss it and
761wish it was there...                                                    O
762@Melody are you reading a PDF file?                                     O
   On the iPhone you just touch and hold your finger on the word and
763the def pops up, Im guessing it would be the same on the android. O
764This is one of my favorite features about Kindle!                       P
765Love my Kindle! Now Im never without a book!                            P
766I love this feature!!!                                                  P
767Like this feature n LOVE my kindle                                      P
   I love being able to have my whole library in my 6" Kindle space and
   having it with me all the time! along with Google, Wikipedia, Bibles
768and notes and my shopping list!                                         P
   but it does not work for foreign words. example French, so it is not
769that great a help.............                                          P
770I Love my kindle!! My favorite x-mas gift ever!                         P
771Love this feature!                                                      P
   this feature makes me a better reader-understanding what authors
772are trying to say ive learned so many new words & its meanings          P
   i still think i should get one for being named kindel frist since i get
   nothing but jokes about it im just saying everywhere i go the second i
   get introduced to someone its "hi my name is kindel" its a for sure
   thing i hear some comment about the amazon kindle so just for the
   jokes alone i should get one of my own and since i will never be able
   to afford one i could now say see i have one :) plus they are way cool
773opened to door for stuff like the i pad and i phone                     P
774Love the feature. Love, love my Kindle.                                 P
775I love this feature and so love my kindle=makes life Good!!             P
   This is the best gift Ive ever received from my children.........thanks
776kids.............                                                       P
777The Kindle is the best!!!!!!!!!                                         P
778Another thing to love about my Kindle!!!                                P
779This is my favorite part of my Kindle!!!!                               P
   try the pandigital realy cool device for reading andmuch more, nice
780size, shape, features, price                                            P
   Thanks for the useful tip and explanation. Please keep posting them
   here. Kindles are chockablock with great features. Its nice to find
781them, be reminded, learn more about what a Kindle can do.               P
   I also love the dictionary feature. I used to just skip over words I
782really didnt know. Not anymore!! It is great.                           P
    Thanks for the tip.. Navigating to the precise word with the 5 way key
783is a pain... I wish I can type it in a the meaning just gets displayed! P
    @Karen, yes you can do in on the original Kindles. You have to
    scroll the wheel up to the row where the word you want defined is,
    then push the scroll button. It will show you the definition for all the
784words on that row.                                                           O
    The Kindle is worth it JUST for the dictionary. Unlike other readers
    you can access the dictionary on its own. And it is a pretty darn good
785dictionary too!                                                              P
786LOVE my kindle. <3                                                           P
787It is a great.                                                               P
788great feature, will use often                                                P
789Love the tips!! More!!                                                       P
790Great feature as Im reading A Tale Of Two Citites                            P
791Thanks for this tip!!! Did not know that!!!                                  O
    I downloaded the Bible on my Kindle, at the suggestion of my son.
792Now I have one less thing to carry.                                          O
793Learn something everyday                                                     O
794Love mine too!!                                                              P
    I bought my first Kindle as a gift for my husband but he wouldnt use
    it!!! I started using it & loved it!!! He Finally decided to use it & I
    couldnt give it up SOO I had to buy another ONE. This past summer
    my son was home from college & he started using MY Kindle SOOO
795Now I have to but another one!!!! We love our Kindles in this family!!! P
796Love Kindle tips!!                                                           P
    and this is one of the reason I buy a Kindle for all the young ones in
    my family. My 9 yo grandson will be surprised to see his with the
797nice blue lighted cover that arrived today!                                  P
    OMG, I wish I would have known about this sooner! BUT, this is the
798coolest thing everrrrrr!!!                                                   P
799It comes in SO handy!!                                                       O
    What an awesome feature. If I ever get one, I will use that for sure.
    Hubby teased me last night by acting like he was going to buy one
800for me & then changed his mind :-(                                           P
    stupid Kindle people - I send PDF documents to be converted today
    & they didnt convert them & then charged me!!! Have an email into
    them now...I already have the PDF format on my Kindle I need a
    Kindle format! I even put CONVERT in CAPS in the subject line &
    body of my emails - how much clearer do I need to be - it said
    CONVER to KINDLE format....grr...grr....NOT HAPPY! NOT HAPPY
    at all...!!!
801                                                                             P
802I too, LOVE my Kindle!                                                       P
803 ??                                                                          O
804I love this feature!                                                         P
    I love this feature. I use it all of the time. I read a tree book last week
    I finally got that I had on hold from the local library for several
    months. I kept trying to find my 5-way and look up words and the
    book was so darn heavy and inconvenient. I was one of those that
    thought I couldnt get used to the idea of an e-reader because I like
805the smell and feel of real books. Now I wouldnt do without my Kindle.P
    Sometimes the definition is at the top of the screen. Depends on
806where the word being defined is located on the page.                         O
807Very handy. Use it all the time.                                             P
    @Barbara Evans, send the email to NAME@free.kindle.com instead
    of NAME@kindle.com to not be charged. I know theres some way to
    get Amazon to convert PDFs instead of just send them, but I cant
    seem to find it. I always use a software program called Calibre when
808I need to convert documents.                                                 O
    As someone who LOVES to read but has a lacking vocabulary, I
    LOVE the built in dictionary. It really helped me get over one of my
    two major reading hurdles. Now if somehow the Kindle can make me
809read faster, Ill be all set :P                                               P
810Another reason I love my Kindle.                                             P
    I still havent been able to archive my books when finished reading.
811Any suggestions, Kindle users?                                               O
    Oh yea I love my kindle and my IPhone kindle like one person said:
812Im Never without a book. JJ                                                  P
    I found this feature to be so helpful while reading Georgette Heyer
    books... there are so many archaic phrases, etc.. Yay,
    Kindle!!Although I find if I go to a 2nd page of a definition, I cant find
    my way back to my book and have to close it and open it again.
813Duh.                                                                         P
814This is a great feature                                                      P
815This is a great feature                                                      P
   Ann- for archiving I made a collection and called it "Read". That way
   I keep track of books and know where Im up to, especially when
   reading a series. Or you could just delete it from your Kindle and it

   I use the dictionary feature all the time and love it EXCEPT when a
817word is spelled WRONG due to a typo :)                                     P
   I use the dictionary feature all the time and love it EXCEPT when a
818word is spelled WRONG due to a typo :)                                     P
819page numbers are nice, also!                                               P
   I love the built-in dictionary, especially reading books by Lincoln
820Childs and Douglas Preston.                                                P
   I love the instant gratification of looking up words on my Kindle! It is
   one of my top five favorite features. I recently read a real book-- after
   keeping constant company with my Kindle since Christmas. The
   thing I missed most about going back to a real book was the lack of
   instant definitions. I tried keeping my Kindle next to me as I read,
   looking up words as needed, but somehowthis method lacks the
821finesse Kindle-reading!                                                    P
822All. I gotta say is this is the best dang thing ever invented!             P
   Any chance to add a foreign dictionary? Im reading "A Child al
   Confino" by Eric Lamet. A wonderful book, but there are snippets of
   dialog in Italian and German/Yiddish. Please consider expanding the
823dictionary options.                                                        P
824Im in love with my Kindle!!!                                               P
   I bought the latest Tom Clancy in hardback form because Ive always
   collected his books. Havent finished it yet cause it is too heavy to
   hold. Im truly spoiled by my Kindle. Probably need to offer the
825hardback for sale & re-buy for Kindle.                                     P
   So luv my Kindle - one of the best gift ever received - luv all the
826features!!!                                                                P
827Thanks for the tip, Ive only had my baby 4 days and love it already P
828I ´ m using it for every 20th word :)                                      P
829Thanks for the tip, very useful :)                                         P
   I really appreciate this being posted so that I can have my Kindle in
830my hand while looking at how to manage it on fb. It really helped me. P
   Minor niggle. It doesnt handle hyphenations well - such as sub-rosa.
   It will define "sub" but then skips "rosa" and goes on to the next
831word. But I love it all the same.                                          P
   We love our Kindles here! My husband and two daughters have one!
   My husband bought each one of us a new Kindle! I love this new
832reading experience!                                                        P
   Built-in dictionary support is great but... You need to move cursor to
   the next world again through all page if popup definition is not
   enough and you need to jump to full world definition: select word -
   read popup - not enough - jump to full definition - return to page -
   current selection disappeared - move cursor from beginning of page
   to next word etc.Another discomfort: if page contains link to footnote,
   you need to move cursor to link through all page with accompanying
   word definitions popup. Too annoying :(Kindle need to have different
833page navigations for word definitions and links                            N
   This is the feature I use the most on my Kindle. Dont skip a word you
   dont know. Read the definition immediately to get more
834understanding from the passage.                                            O
835I just keep hitting back button to get back to the page I was reading. O
   Can someone please tell me if you can read your Kindle in the dark?
   Does it have internal lighting like reading on the IPhone does? I
836looked at the Nook and it does not and I need that feature.                O
   Diane,All E_Inc books (AFAIR) does not have built-in lighting (or
   illumitation). You need to buy cover with built-in light or stand-alone
837light.                                                                     O
   I really appreciate the enlarging font size. It makes night reading
838easier                                                                     P
839Thats why I chose Kindle!                                                  O
840Love my Kindle!                                                            P
841Thanks for the tip. I will be using this one!!                             O
842So much easier than the way I was doing it.                                P
   I think posting these little hints is a great idea. I know there must be
843things that I am able to do but have never noticed or figured out.         P
844Thanks Kindle -- I love you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!                                 P
   And I love that feature...use it all the time, well, I should say
845frequently.                                                                P
   I use this feature all the time. Not sure it will help me learn, but it is
846nice to know what the word means in the moment.                            P
   If Kindle could reach out and taser those bothering me while I read,
847that will be a good app.                                                   O
    I too love this feature. Keep trying to find the dictionary toggle on my
848morning news paper, sadly it doesnt seem to have one.                      P
849I LOVE that feature!                                                       P
    Ann light, when you finish reading book remove book from device,it
850will automatically be archived when you remove the book                    O
851Didnt know that thanks.                                                    O
852One of my favourite features :-)                                           P
    I have cetatinly found the text enlarging useful as i have cataracts
    forming so the larger print makes reading easier. I truely love my
853Kindlexxx                                                                  P
854Easily my fav feature among many. Kindle simply rocks                      O
    I love the dictionary. I have been using it for almost 2 years. Its great
855when reading Twain or Swedish books.                                       P
    Thanks for the info on archiving--Diane: re reading the Kindle in the
    dark: there is a cover that is lighted which you can purchase from
856amazon.                                                                    O
857love these reminder tips!!!!! keep them coming!                            P
858I love the dictionary feature!                                             P
    I use an inexpensive led light that straps onto me head with an
    elastic band, and runs on AA batteries. The light can be used for
859other things too, not just to light up me Kindle.                          P
860Luv my Kindle !!!!                                                         P
861Please make a Ukrainian dictionary!                                        O
862^ Spam.                                                                    O
863could help them learn to read, wouldnt that be cool.                       P
864wow that was rude!!                                                        N
    Does Amazon have a program to donate Kindles to developing
865countries?                                                                 O
866i think thats the point... so they can learn to read...                    O
    AMAZON - you need to get the junk off from here. I know not to click
    on these links, but others might not. Bunch of idiots. As for India -
    they have most of our businesses now - not in favor of sending them
867anything. Sorry!                                                           N
    Report PROFILE VIEWS TRACKER as spam so we dont have to
868put up with this all the time!                                             O
    A great article........a great idea.......somebody should be sending
869Kindles to the poverty stricken regions of the globe. I love it!           P
870Great story. And he has a point.                                           P
871lets make them solar powered first                                         O
    Andrea, that was my point too, lol. Im sure the purpose is to help
    people read, if they were only donated to people who already know
    how to read then lets donate them to everyone.
872                                                                           P
    i think sending the developing world kindles would be an awesome
    idea!! it could help them learn to read, there are dictionaries on it to
    help, and they could communicate with people all over the world with
873facebook (i am posting this from my kindle 3) :D                           P
    Oh a solar powered Kindle would be great!! Not only for developing
    countries but for our own too!! Can you imagine not having to worry
874about losing the charger cable ever again???                               N
    I too just returned from India - Southern India and the children were
    fascinated by the Kindle! A very poor country, where the people work
    harder than I have ever seen people work. While I love my kindle
    and think they to would love and enjoy one - they couldnt afford the
875cost of books or internet. The average salary is 5US dollars a day. P
    It would also be great it the average US citizen could afford them.
876Kindles are awesome, but I work 2 jobs and I cant afford one!              P
    Send my son a Kindle and load his school books on it to relieve his
877frame of carrying home 20 pounds of books and binder daily.                O
    Seriously Margaret? Do we just assume now that anyone in the
    ghettos of the world a.k.a "developing countries" cant read? As if
    your capitalized sentence didnt ooze sarcasm. How could you think
878that wasnt rude?                                                           N
    While there are issues to work out (power, etc.), this was a very well
    written essay and I commend the writer for it. Capturing the essence
879of a powerful experience is what world travel is all about.                P
    @Karen God forbid your son should have to exorcise a bit. They
    want to give Kindles do people who have NOTHING and youre
880complaining about your son you want to be obese.                           N
881Id like to buy the world a Coke...and a Kindle. :)                         P
   Unfortunately I agree with Karen on the overly heavy schoolbooks
   comment, however they make Kindle formats of many textbooks
   now, so hopefully that will alleviate that stress soon. As for sending
   Kindles to the modernizing world I believe it would be a great idea in
   theory and probably a horrible idea in practice. I also believe there
   are greater concerns in those countries that we need to tackle first
882before sending them Kindles.                                              O
   @ C.j.: Because that is what I do professionally...working for
   programs that teach illiterate adults here and abroad. And in the
   developing countries, most of the adults are functionally illiterate--not
   their fault. The capitalized sentence wasnt to "ooze sarcasm" at the
   people, but at the idea we can send technology and it will all
   magically be better. Trust me on this: learning to read as an adult is
   hard work, and only happens with lots of work by the teachers/tutors
883and the students.                                                         N
   I think its interesting that there are so many that assume people in
   developing countries go not read. Did anyone read the post, one of
   the kids was more excited about reading off the kindle then playing
   around with it. What I took is that the kindle has the potential to
   renew the interest of the reader and create some excitement that for
884now a traditional book is lacking.                                        P
   @ John Tapley carrying books around causing back issues has
   nothing to do with exercise. If doing so made kids less fat, then why
   would there be fat youths still? Get over yourself. Textbooks on
   kindles would be great. Not so great for irresponsible kids (which is
885nearly all of them)                                                       N
   Get a better back pack and quit whining about the fact that SCHOOL
886KIDS have to carry BOOKS.                                                 P

   What a delightful and joyful article! I was in a very smart restaurant in
   Goa about 2 months ago reading my Kindle - the guy at the next
   table got out his iPad for nothing seemingly more than a bit of
   showing off. The waiters were fascinated by the Kindle and all
889wanted to play with it. They ignored the iPad.                            P
   What a brilliant article and idea! I love my Kindle and learn
   something new every day I read it! The dictionary would be so
   helpful and the text to speech would help in learning to read!
890BRILLIANT                                                                 P
   God, what a great idea! With the need for books being so profound
891in the developing world, Kindles could be the answer!                     P
   This would certainly benefit Amazon. LolBut really, it would be an
892inexpensive way to spread the wisdom of books.                            P
   AGREE, AGREE, Agree if I could like this post a million times I
893would. Teach a man to fish! Not sell crap on Ebay. :-)                    P
   One of my sons has dyslexia. I would read books required for high
   school English into a tape recorder and he would listen to them. A
   Kindle would have saved so much time. What a blessing technology
894is! This is an amazing tool for dyslexics.                                  P
   Not just developing countries. 25% of the American population is
   functionally illiterate. We have highschool graduates who can not
895read their diplomas. Does it get worse than that?                           N
896Id rather send comdoms.....or the pill                                      O
897Exactly right, Dragana.                                                     O
898Stop buying textbooks for kids in school. Give them Kindles.                O
   They would benefit from decent medication, food and contraception
899first before a Kindle                                                       P
   Id like to see kindles donated to low income families and schools in
   the United States as well. There are children who dont have access
900to books everywhere!                                                        P
901@Erica pentz: yes! Fantastic idea!                                          P
   Im going to agree with Margaret on this one. The fact is that reading
   is a learned skill and there are many countries which havent yet
   learned it. Its just plain ignorant to think that there ARENT people
   who dont have this skill. And about the backpacks and textbooks on
   the kindle, its really an issue of publishers and copyrights and
   software/hardware issues. A device like (dare I utter it here?) the
902IPad would be able to handle such a purpose far better.                     P
903Very interesting ... :-)                                                    P
   Wait ....Bri...we can go on fb on the kindle...I need to find a kid for a
904lesson                                                                      O
905AGREE!!!                                                                  O
   Ive gotten almost that good of a reaction with my Kindle 1 at my
   husbands eye specialists office. Someone with very limited vision
   has their world opened again with the font changing option. I have
   been a walking advertisement several times personally. Kindle
906needs to direct advertise to ophthalmologists!                            N
   How about sending this USA struggling author a Kindle? My book is
907available, on it, and I cannot see it.                                    N
   Its a shame all the negative garbage back and forth just because a
   decent person wrote an article about his vision to help other people.
   That was a great article! There is way too much tearing things apart
908instead of looking at the intent of the article.                          O
909need to know how to SHARE books??????                                     O
   Why give things away? Why not offer it to them at a price they can
   afford? Giving low income families kindles may sound nice, but how
   about offering a work for a kindle program where low income teens
   and adults alike could do things like work in a soup kitchen, help
   clean up parks, and clean graffiti from public areas for x amount of
   hours in exchange for a kindle?That way they would have pride in
   knowing they earned it, and it would prevent most of them from
910selling it for cash                                                       P
   Create source of income first jackass how do u propose they pay for
   the books the wanna read when they can hardly afford food.these
   people are dining from hunger and thirst and u wanna give them a
   kindle your effing sick if u see kids in rags traveling miles away so

   I bought a Bible for $1.99 We send Bibles to Russian schools and
913we cant even pray in schools. CONDOMS....spelling!                        O
   solar is not really necessary as there are tools to charge via bicycle,
   playgrounds, etc. ... books are simple, there are plenty of free books
914available on the Web via Project Gutenberg, Amazon, etc.                  P

   I love my Kindle. It has saved me from a few otherwise boring waits,
916thats for sure!                                                           P

   This is actually a great idea. Think of all the rural schools in Africa
   and elsewhere desperate for books, and think of all the great books
921available for free on Kindle!                                             P
922Cool story and a very good idea.                                          P

   Rashean... you are a great example of why people need
   books."Create source of income first jackass how do u propose they
   pay for the books the wanna read when they can hardly afford
   food.these people are dining from hunger and thirst and u wanna
   give them a kindle your effing sick if u see kids in rags traveling miles
   away so they can have drinking water and your first thought is to
   give them a kindle"Create (a) source of income first jackass(.) (H)ow
   do (yo)u propose they pay for the books (Im assuming you mean
   "they want to")the wanna read when they can hardly afford food.( T
   )these people are (dying?)dining from hunger and thirst and (yo)u

   see kids in rags traveling miles away so they can have drinking
   water and your first thought is to give them a kindleAlso, Im sure no
   one here is suggesting you go find a community that has no food, no
   running water and no electricity and give them an electronic device.
   They mean to go to poverty struck areas where children cant afford
   books, but already have the basics, i.e. (that means for example)
   food and water and give those children a means to get an education
924they wouldnt otherwise have.                                              N
925I would like a kindle sent to me...                                       P
   might have a point but what revolution would come from reading the
926classics?                                                                 O
   @Judy: loaning books on kindle is available. Go to your amazon
   account, manage your account, check the books listed and see
   which ebooks are available to loan not all are. They will be a box by
   each of the book titles that you will have click on that will read if the
927ebook can be loaned out. Then just follow the rest.                       O
928I live in Africa! You can send me a Kindle!                               O
929Do you have an office in India?                                           O
   Katie, regarding your correction and comments above, I guess you
   didnt realize that "your effing sick" should actually be "youre", not just
   capitalized. And I believe the phrase is "poverty stricken" not
930"poverty struck".                                                         O
   Some disgusting comments on this post! "I would rather send
   condoms or the pill!" uh I think America and the Uk could benefit
   from those also looking at the single teen pregnancies, but our kids
931still have access to the kindle! Come on guys....Grow up please!          O
   BRilliant idea....how much battery life that thing have tho? pair it with
932a generator so they can charge it!                                        P

963are by the pool in the sunlight =)                                    P
   My Kindle was the best thing for my eyes! I love to read, but often
964didnt because my eyes would tire so quickly, no longer the case!      P
965Great tag line: The Book Lives On                                     P

968Am loving my Kindle so much I should name it.                         P
   I love my kindle, and I love the customer support that comes with it.
   My cats knocked my original one off the dresser, and Amazon gave
   me a free replacement since they said it was covered under the
969limited warranty. The replacement was there the next day!             P

   mmm No esto no es un iPad, es un libro; No tampoco es una
   compu, es un libro; No no tiene juegos, es un libro; Si tiene wi-fi, si
   tiene conectividad 3g gratis en todo el mundo de por vida, Si se
   pueden leer los libros que bajas de internet, no no tienes que
   comprárselos a AMAZON si no quieres. Si, se pueden meter dentro
   de este libro electrónico miles de libros digitales. Si se pueden leer
   los .doc .pdf etc convirtiéndolos con una herramienta muy muy
976simple de usar.                                                          N
977Love my kindle and the leather cover with light is great.                P
978I love my kindle !!!!!!                                                  P
979Now, if the Kindle just had expandable memory...                         O
980Just bought mine and am LOVING it !!!                                    P
   Throw it my purse and go. Have my whole library,some games,
   docs, and basic web for referencing at my fingure tips for when ever
981I need it!                                                               N
   Yall should make The Book Lives On: Amazon Kindle T-shirts and
982give me one for such a great idea =)                                     P
   Now if only it displayed in color e-ink, and had better integration with
   e-text books, I could stop buying reference books and using my
   laptop for course reading.... Just saying. Other than that, I adore my
983kindle.                                                                  P
   I love my kindle. I downloaded all the book club books on it for the
   year. I take it everywhere. I use it while I am waiting to pick the kids
   up at school, after practices, doctors offices, ortho appointments. If
   you want to appeal to Moms throw some of those scenarios in a
984commercial.                                                              P
985Love my Kindle too! Would be lost without it..                           O
   I like my Kindle...I will LOVE my Kindle when they finally allow
   libraries to check out books to us in the Kindle format. Come on
986Amazon lending libraries are a good thing!                               P
987I love MINE!!!                                                           P
988Love it                                                                  P
   Nice! I cringed a bit when the people were balancing on fences and
989leaping around holding their Kindles...Id call that living dangerously! O
990I love my Kindle too!!!                                                  P
991I heart my kindle!!!                                                     O
   I was reading with it for around 8 hours yesterday and the battery is
992hardly even drained. <3 my Kindle!                                       N
   Love my Kindle3 + the cover with light. Waiting to buy DX when Wi-fi
993available.                                                               P
994SOOOO much better than your other commercials! Well done!                P
   I liked it. Its youth oriented and I think this will further widen its
995appeal.                                                                  P
   I think the point of the commercial is that, even with Borders closing
   many stores and publishers struggling, THE BOOK LIVES ON...just
   in a different format. The eBook is the future, whether people like it
996or not, and the Kindle is the best platform for it, in my opinion.       P
997Kindle 3 is such a great product. I could not be happier with mine! :-) P
   develop a way to share books! that is a big drawback. I love my
998kindle but hate that I cant share books as easily as I did before.       N
999I love my kindle! =)                                                     P
